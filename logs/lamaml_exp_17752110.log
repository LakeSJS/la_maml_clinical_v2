Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /gpfs/data/oermannlab/NYUTron/model_zoos/nyutron_small/checkpoint-736000 and are newly initialized: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight', 'classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
